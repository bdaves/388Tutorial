    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the flashy parts of data science involve using pre-collected data and analyzing it to obtain meaningful observations. However, the key to being able to do any of this is the data. There are many problems that could be analyzed quite easily if only datasets were available to be analyzed. However, this data collection process can often be the hardest part of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method of data collection that is very accessible is web scraping. This is the process of going through websites and systematically obtaining data from them. Of course, this can be done manually, but that would be extremely inefficient. Instead, the common method employed is to use a web scraper - an application that can scrape without manual intervention and do that job much faster and more efficiently than a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to scrapy, an easy python webscraper that can be used without having to manually code an entire scraper from the ground up."
